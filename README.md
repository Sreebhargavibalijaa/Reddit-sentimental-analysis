# Redditcontentanalysis
Since the advent of social media, data transmission has improved tremendously. People could share data(text, video, images, audio, etc;) in the form of posts. The most common platform where people post about diverse topics is Reddit. From the Reddit Submissions dataset, we have tried to predict the success of the post or submission, based on
different features such as the submission time, posted community, title length, etc; We have used several Regression, TF-IDF, transformer models to evaluate the co-dependencies among different features in the Dataset.
